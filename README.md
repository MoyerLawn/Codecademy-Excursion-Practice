# Learn Git & GitHub Course Project

## Introduction

I'm excited to share my project for the Learn Git & GitHub course on Codecademy. In this project, I have created a webpage to reinforce my understanding of git commands for cloning repositories, pushing/pulling, committing and much more. This was also a good lesson regarding my HTML and CSS skills

## Project Overview

### Purpose
The main goal of this project was to apply the concepts learned in the course, especially focusing on using Git and GitHub effectively. Additionally, I wanted to improve my HTML and CSS skills by creating a simple, yet visually appealing webpage.

### Webpage Features

- **Content:** The webpage contains information about downloading a fake app called "Excursion". This app helps users record and share their experiences.

- **Styling:** I used CSS to style the webpage, ensuring it's visually appealing and user-friendly. The design reflects the course's theme and is intended to make it easy for visitors to navigate the content.

- **Git Integration:** Throughout the project, I utilized git commands for version control. This helped me practice using Git in a real-world scenario, from creating branches to committing changes and pushing them to GitHub.

## Technologies Used

Here's a brief overview of the technologies I used for this project:

- **HTML:** I structured the webpage's content using HTML, creating a clean and organized layout.

- **CSS:** CSS was used to style the webpage, making it visually appealing and ensuring a consistent look and feel.

- **Git & GitHub:** I employed Git and GitHub for version control, allowing me to track changes, collaborate with others, and maintain a history of my work.

## Conclusion

This project was an excellent learning experience, allowing me to apply the knowledge gained from the Learn Git & GitHub course and hone my HTML and CSS skills. I now have a practical example of using Git and GitHub for version control, which will be invaluable in future projects and collaborations.

Feel free to check out the project on GitHub https://github.com/MoyerLawn/MoyerLawn.github.io to explore the code and the webpage itself.

Thank you for reviewing my work, and I look forward to continuing to develop my skills in web development and version control with Git and GitHub.
